# WhutThe's fork of kocmoc

<b>⚠ Discontinued as the maintainer's account was reset for using the original version of kocmoc. This fork will not be actively maintained, and thus may not have the most up-to-date bypasses. Use at your own risk. ⚠</b>

Setup:
Download Python, and copy [external/filesystem_proxy.py](external/filesystem_proxy.py) just above your executor's workspace folder. (the directory with the exe)
Run that file. (if synapse's read/write functions didnt have a memory leak 💀 i wouldnt have to do ths)
Open [Bee Swarm Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/1537690962/Bee-Swarm-Simulator) and run [kocmocblue.lua](kocmocblue.lua)
<br /><br />
Alternatively, you can enable the `lightweight` option, and just run [kocmocblue.lua](kocmocblue.lua) (you'll be missing out on some features though)

# Main Features
<b>⭐Legit Mode</b>: No teleports, no exploit-y stuff. To any ordinary player, you will seem like you're playing the game normally (consider this an alternative to macros)
